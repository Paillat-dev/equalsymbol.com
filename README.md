# Equal Symbol (=) - The Most Balanced Website

An exaggerated, slightly obsessive, but entirely serious deep-dive into the equal symbol. Built with Astro, Tailwind CSS 5, and way too much enthusiasm.

- **Comprehensive Unicode Reference**: Complete tables with Unicode, HTML codes, and Alt codes
- **Rich Historical Context**: From Robert Recorde's 1557 invention to modern usage
- **Philosophical Exploration**: Mathematical truth, geometric perfection, and cultural significance
- **Cross-Disciplinary Applications**: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and more
- **Interactive FAQ**: Everything you never knew you wanted to know about "="
- **Modern Design**: Purple-pink gradients, backdrop blur, and smooth animations
- **Static Site**: Blazing fast, compiles to pure HTML/CSS/JS

- **Accessible** with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

2. **Stats** - Ridiculous but true statistics
3. **Introduction** - What is the equal symbol?
4. **Symbol Variations** - 16 clickable symbol cards
5. **Unicode Reference** - Complete technical table
6. **Historical Deep Dive** - Timeline from 1557 to present
